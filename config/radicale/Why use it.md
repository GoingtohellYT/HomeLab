### Why use it?

By default, most contacts and calendar services are not end-to-end encrypted, even though they can contain sensitive information such as personal addresses, medical appointments, and more.  

SaaS solutions exist (Proton, Tutanota, for example), but they usually cannot be accessed outside of their own apps and often do not use the CalDAV and CardDAV standards needed for end-to-end encryption.  

Radicale, while not end-to-end encrypted itself, offers the best of both worlds: it uses well-established standards, making it compatible with many clients, and handles syncing on my own server so this data never has to go on a company's servers. You only have to trust the client you use to access this data!

### Something unusual about this version

I use a specific version of Radicale for this service because it manages personal data, and I do not want to risk data loss due to an automatic upgrade.
