## Why use FresRSS ?

When I first heard about RSS, I wondered what all the fuss was about.
If you want to read the news, why not just visit the website and pick the article you want, instead of receiving hundreds throughout the day â€” or just get a newsletter?

Then I realized that RSS lets you access information in a more seamless way. It also lets you move newsletters out of your email inbox (using a service like Kill the Newsletter), which keeps my inbox far less cluttered.
