### Why use Uptime-Kuma ?

While Grafana allows me to monitor the server itself with metrics about hardware usage, Uptime-Kuma focuses on the services running on the server, alerting me when one goes down.  

It monitors the uptime of these services rather than the resources they consume, providing an important layer of insight on a different level.

It can also notify me using Discord.
