### Why use Jelu ?

I’ll admit, this one is more for fun than anything else — I just love seeing the stats of how many books and pages I’ve read over time.

Writing comments for the books I’ve enjoyed (even if I’m the only one reading them) helps me reflect on each read. That’s something important I’ve carried over from studying literature with the Aseica all these years.

This service also replaces my old Excel sheet that tracked where my lent-out books were. I could do all this in a dedicated Anytype space, but that would be time-consuming, and I’d probably want to add movies, shows, and music there too to make it more centralized. That feels unnecessary since Jellyfin already contains all the metadata.

And with over 700 books in Jelu, I’m not about to manually migrate to something else anytime soon!
